12/4/19 3:36 PM,http://villainousxlove.tumblr.com/post/189472333061,"Winter care tips Hey. Late fall/Winter can really be a hard time to keep up with self care. The cold temperatures can be harsh on skin, getting sick is way easier, and being outside for a moderate amount of time isn’t always possible (or fun). Here are some self care tips for winter! (Keep in mind, I am NOT a professional or doctor. If you actually believe you may be experiencing a medical issue I would advise seeing one) Skin care: •A little bit of Virgin coconut oil and then Vaseline can make your lips super smooth. •Moisturizer is your best friend. •For smooth feet put vaseline on your feet every night and wear socks over them. I did this when I was applying for a shoe modeling job and it worked wonders. Cold and Flu prevention: •GET VACCINATED! While this doesn’t always mean you won’t get the flu it will likely make it way less intense. I knew someone who only had the flu for several days last year because she was vaccinated. While it didn’t prevent it entirely, it minimized what could have happened. If you are one of those rare people who vaccines don’t effect, make sure you spread how important it is that OTHERS get vaccinated. •Wash your hands. I cannot stress this enough. Try to avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. •Try not to share drinks with other people. •Don’t kiss someone who you know is sick. •Try to stay warm enough. The cold itself doesn’t actually give you a cold, but it lowers your immune system since your body has to work to keep you warm. •Green Tea is fantastic. Common cold self care: •Peppermint essential oil can really help clear up your sinuses. Put some on several cotton balls/pads and put them under your pillow case to help your breathe better at night while you sleep. Just be careful and make sure you don’t put too much so it doesn’t go through the pillowcase and onto your eyes. •Speaking of sleep, get enough of it. Nap if you have to. Rest is crucial in healing from a cold. •If you eat meat, chicken noodle soup is a go to. •Stay hydrated. •Some ginger can help a sore throat. So can honey. Many people put honey in their tea, but eating it off a spoon is more effective. Remember that these tips are NOT for infants as babies under a year should not eat honey. •Ginger is also good for nausea. I love Trader Joe’s ginger chews. •Make sure you get enough vitamin c. This doesn’t mean chug one and a half cartons of orange juice per day, as any extra vitamin c your body will just flush out. •If you’re sick and someone doesn’t want to stand near you PLEASE DON’T BE OFFENDED. I’m a performer and loosing my voice is one of the worst feelings for me right before a performance. This is especially true if the person is a parent or looks after someone with a lower immune system such as a nursing home or day care worker. Even if they don’t, you didn’t want to get sick. Neither do they. •Vomiting can cause you to loose electrolights. Once you’re feeling well enough, try to drink some Gatorade. The BRAT diet is recommended for people with nausea. I’ve been on it PLENTY of times myself. •Try to put some moisturizer around your nostrils now and then if you’ve been blowing your nose a lot. The skin can get raw and irritated. Other: •Wearing warm socks (especially those made for around the house without shoes like fuzzy ones) can make your entire body feel much warmer. Try it if you’re chilly at home. •If you see someone wearing gloves inside don’t be rude about it. I have a rare form of eczema that causes my hands to look like a giant scale is growing on top of them that you could just tear off. When it was at its worst growing up, my parents and I didn’t quite know what it was. So my options were to either keep moisturizer on me at all times (which I couldn’t because of things like gym class) and literally apply it every fifteen minutes, or apply it every hour or so and wear fingerless gloves to cover it up. They looked cute and emo/rocker chick as hell and I got shit for it.",,,

Adrien lowered his newspaper with a deep, thoughtful scowl, staring out the window in deep contemplation. 

“I would like you to change our dry cleaners,” Adrien said decisively. “My red slacks have been getting less and less red lately and I’m afraid that’s simply unacceptable.” 


“Yes sir,” Nathalie said, hiding her smile behind a coffee cup. “I’ll take care of it as soon as I can.” 


“See that you do,” Adrien said, sipping his orange juice thoughtfully. “I’m not paying them to turn my cherry slacks into rose refugees from a Devo music video. It’s completely unacceptable.” 


“Completely unacceptable, sir,” Nathalie agreed, flicking through her tablet absently. 


“Completely unacceptable,” Adrien echoed. “Incidentally, do tell me when Adrien’s fencing meet is so I can schedule a meeting with our investors at the same time.” 


“Already taken care of,” Nathalie said, reorganizing Gabriel’s schedule with a few deft flicks of her fingers so a gaping hole appeared from four to five. 


“Excellent,” Adrien said with a firm nod. “Now, onto the subject of the forthcoming trip to China-” 


The dining room door opened, cutting Adrien off as his father strode in, taking his place at the head of the table as Nathalie and Adrien immediately pretended to be engrossed in their paper and tablet respectively. 

“Good morning father,” Adrien said, taking a sip of his orange juice. 


“Good morning, Mr. Agreste,” Nathalie said, taking a small sip of her coffee. 


“Adrien; Nathalie,” Gabriel said, eyes roaming over the pair of them for a moment before opening the business section. “…oh, before I forget Nathalie, I need you to change our dry-cleaners-” 


Gabriel flinched back, paper rising to protect himself from the sprays of orange juice and coffee that sprayed from Adrien and Nathalie’s noses.

Summary: Human AU. Virgil’s back goes out. 

CW: Pain, cursing, negative thoughts, self-deprecation

Pairing: PolyamSanders/Lamp/Calm (romantic but not explicit)

Notes:  This is pure vent-fic. I wrote most of it two days ago when my back was particularly bad. Most of Virgil’s experience is lifted directly from my own. 

Virgil felt it the moment he woke up. 

It started as just a twinge in the small of his spine, but he was far too familiar with himself to write it off. Ten years of pain, MRI scans, physical therapy sessions and chiropractor visits (not to mention popping ibuprofen like it was candy) had left him only too aware of the warning signs. 

His back was going out. 

No, he thought, eyes flying open as he struggled to roll to his side in bed. No no no no no, please, no. Not today.  

Today. Fucking today–why did it have to be today? Today, the first day all three of his boyfriends had off together in over two months? Today, when they were supposed to be going out to celebrate Roman getting the part in his play and Logan’s dissertation being approved by his committee? Today, when Patton had traded three weekend shifts with the other pediatric nurses and Virgil himself had rescheduled three major clients at the tattoo parlor? 

Why today?  

He pushed himself into a sitting position, hissing as the twinge turned into a series of sharp, painful jolts that shot down his spine toward his pelvis. He sucked in a deep breath and tightened the muscles of his abdominal wall, trying to visualize pulling his tailbone in toward his belly button the way the last therapist had told him to. Sandra, her name had been. She’d been all about core strength, insisting that the lack of said strength was at the root of most back problems. 

Maybe she was right; maybe not. Virgil himself was more inclined to blame the combination of a long torso and years of sitting hunched over his sketchbook with a pencil, then over an expanse of bare skin with a tattoo needle. 

Whatever it was, the scans had confirmed it: his back was fucked, and it was going to stay that way for the rest of his life. 

“You’ll have good days and bad,” the orthopedic surgeon had told him, after the first incident. He’d been barely over eighteen, and had been working unloading boxes of food at a grocery store. He’d bent down one day and simply hadn’t been able to stand back up. “If you stick with your physical therapy you can push it to more good than bad, but you’ll probably still have blow outs now and then.” 


“There’s…nothing you can do?” Virgil had asked haltingly, staring at the blurred translucent black-and-white film that was his MRI scan. It meant nothing to him, but the multitude of little red circles and scrawled notes were easy enough to interpret. 

“We could do spinal fusion,” the surgeon said, but the doubtful air in his voice didn’t instill Virgil with a lot of confidence. 

“That sounds kinda serious,” he’d said. 


“It is. And there’s no guarantee it wouldn’t make things worse instead of better. Especially since you’re probably not done growing, and spinal fusion could cause all sorts of other problems. I’m far more inclined to stick with more conservative options.” 


Those options, as it turned out, had involved trips to the pain management center, referrals to specialists, and half a dozen printouts where crude drawings mapped out the various exercises that were supposed to help him get better. 

He’d tried to do them. He really had. But he’d still been in school, at the time, working his way through his bachelor’s degree, trying to hang onto a full-time job and a scholarship at the same time, and when it came down to a choice between half an hour of therapy or an extra half an hour of sleep, sleep usually won out. 

Now, ten years later, he was reaping the rewards of those decisions. 

He managed to climb to his feet, wincing, but breathing a sigh of relief as the pain faded a little. Standing was easier on his back than sitting, and walking sometimes seemed to make everything settle back where it was supposed to be. Sometimes.

He took a few tentative steps toward his kitchen. It was only six am; Roman and Logan, at least, wouldn’t be up until ten at the earliest, and Patton would be out walking their dog Patches. He wouldn’t hear from them for several hours at least. If he could just down some orange juice and a couple pain pills, maybe lie down on an ice pack for a few hours, he would be good to go, if he was lucky. 

He should have known better than to rely on his luck. 

* 

“Hey, knock knock!” the friendly voice on the other side of the door woke Virgil from his drug-induced half-doze, and he drew in a sharp breath and jerked slightly–then cried out as the movement sent a sharp stab of pain through his back. 

Dammit! the events of the morning came back in a rush, along with a growing sense of dread. He fumbled for his phone, which he’d left on the end table, and peered at it, cringing when he saw the three missed texts and new voicemail alerts. 

On our way over! Patton had texted. 

Be ready to go, we’ve got a big day! That was Roman. 

And I hope you don’t mind the opera for this evening because I couldn’t talk Roman out of it. 

Shit. Shit. Virgil glanced at the door and hesitated. 

“Virgil? You there?” Roman sounded annoyed. “If he overslept, I swear–” 


“Virgil doesn’t oversleep, Roman.” Logan. 

“He’s probably got his headphones on. Do you have your key?” 

A fumble, then the sound of metal sliding into the lock. Before Virgil could react, the door swung open, and his boyfriends piled in, one after another, looking unfairly gorgeous and brilliantly happy. 

Patton saw him first, and his eyes lit up. He bounded over, a ball of energy and enthusiasm. “Hey, wake up, sleepyhead!” he cried, reaching out as though to pull Virgil to his feet. “It’s time to–”

“Don’t touch me!” 

Patton halted abruptly, startled, and Virgil cringed as the other two gave him looks of surprise. His voice had been a little sharper than he’d meant, but the thought of the damage Patton could do if he’d tried to move Virgil right now…he barely suppressed a shudder. 

“Sorry,” he said, lowering his eyes. “I just…um. My…my back’s…hurting.” 


His announcement was met with silence,and he closed his eyes, not wanting to see the looks on their faces. Would they be disappointed? Disgusted? Annoyed? Angry, even? It had happened plenty of times before. Not with them, maybe, but he couldn’t count the number of friends and exes who’d found his back to be a terrible inconvenience. 

It’s hurting again? It was fine yesterday…

Is it really that bad? Can’t you just take some tylenol? 

C’mon, man, you said you’d go to the pub crawl with us! Are you seriously backing out again? 

As if it was something he wanted. As if it wasn’t ruining his life, one pain-filled day after another. 

“Oh,” Patton backed up a little, hands up. “Sorry.” 


“Did you do something to it?” Roman asked, frowning as he moved forward and studied Virgil’s careful position on the couch: stretched on his back, knees bent and feet elevated on a cushion, towel under his back in case the ice pack leaked. 


Virgil laughed bitterly, then winced when the effort sent a new spike of agony down his spine. “I existed,” he said. “That’s apparently enough.” 

“Oh.” 


Logan closed the apartment door then moved to stand at the end of the couch, frowning as well. “Did you take anything for it?” 

“Yeah,” Virgil sighed, closing his eyes. “I took ibuprofen and a pain pill.” 

“It didn’t help?” 


Virgil twisted his mouth into a wry not-smile. “It helped. Some. But…” He trailed off. 

“But it still hurts?” Patton guessed.


“Yeah.” 


“So…I guess…this means you can’t go today?” 

Virgil sighed, opening his eyes at last, and glancing up to see the others shifting somewhat awkwardly, casting uncertain glances at one another. He’d told them about his back problems–it was one of his standard disclaimers, when meeting someone new–but he hadn’t had a blowout like this, not since they’d started dating, and they’d never seen it. For them, it had only been a theoretical. 

Apparently today, his body was ready to make it a reality. 

“Look, I’m…I’m sorry, guys, but I really don’t think I can,” he said at last, deciding that a straightforward confession would be better than this uncomfortable silence. “You should go ahead and have fun, though.” 


“Are…are you sure?” Patton’s voice was soft and distressed. “Don’t you need us to…?” 


“I really don’t,” Virgil said immediately. Dammit, he might be a killjoy, but he was not going to ruin their fun. “Seriously, go. Have fun. I’ll…” his voice choked, and he bit back the words that had been trying to escape: I’ll go with you next time. 

He couldn’t promise that, could he? There was never any telling when the bad days were going to hit, and even if there were, he certainly couldn’t be assured of a ‘next time’ at all. His part in the relationship was too new, too fragile, and they were only now getting their first taste of what dealing with him was really like. There was a very good chance they would decide it wasn’t worth it. That he wasn’t worth it. 

He said instead: “I’ll be fine on my own.” 

“Okay,” Roman said doubtfully, after a moment. “If you’re absolutely certain…” 


“I am,” Virgil said, proud when his voice didn’t waver. He looked up at them and gave them a tight smile. “I’ve got my remote and my TV and my phone. I’m set.” 


“Do you need anything else, before we…?” Logan nodded at the door. 


“No. I’m good.” 


“Are you absolutely sure? Something to eat? Drink?” 


Virgil bit back an exasperated sigh, knowing Logan only wanted to help. “If you want to grab me a soda before you leave, that’d be cool,” he said. 

“Of course.” Logan moved toward the refrigerator immediately. 

Virgil looked up at Patton, who was still gazing down at him with worried eyes, and offered him a smile. “It’s okay, Dad,” he murmured, using the nickname Patton had earned from the other nurses in pediatrics. “Really. I’m used to it.” 

“I just…hate seeing you in pain,” Patton said, and Virgil felt a tiny curl of warmth in his gut. Patton always had been the most compassionate of them. Abruptly, Virgil felt his eyes stinging, and he had to blink several times and look away. 

“Thanks,” he whispered. 


“Um…Virgil?” Logan had returned from the kitchen. “You’re out of soda.” 


Virgil closed his eyes again. Of fucking course. Why not? “Probably just as well,” he said aloud. “It would just make me need to get up and pee, and the fewer times I have to get up, the better.” 


“We could run down to the gas station and get you some…?” Roman offered, but Virgil shook his head immediately. He’d already ruined their plans enough; no way was he going to make them start running errands. 

“No, don’t worry about it. Really. If I get thirsty I’ll drink water. It’s better for me anyway, right, Pat?” 

Patton shrugged and nodded.

“If…if you’re sure you don’t need anything…?” 


“I am,” Virgil insisted again. “The best thing for me to do right now is take another pain pill and try to sleep this off. You guys go have fun, okay?” 


They glanced at one another again, then Patton sighed, and nodded. 

“Okay,” he said, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to Virgil’s forehead. “We have our phones on us, though. Call if you need anything?” 


Virgil nodded, throat tightening again at the soft press of Patton’s lips against his brow. How many more times would he get to feel that? How many more times before they sat him down and had that awkward, shifty-eyed conversation where they admitted that while he was a great guy and all, they just hadn’t signed on for this, so, so long, farewell, auf wiedersehen goodbye? 

Roman shuffled over next, leaning down and kissing Virgil’s cheek; Logan didn’t kiss him at all, but leaned over and awkwardly touched his hair. 

“Feel better, Virgil,” he said. “We’ll see you soon, okay?” 


Virgil closed his eyes and nodded once. “Sure,” he said, trying to keep his voice light and unconcerned. 

But the moment they closed his door behind him, the tears started to fall. He brought his arm up in front of his mouth to stifle the sobs that wanted to escape, and bit down a little to keep himself from shaking with them–that would only hurt him more. 

Dammit. Dammit. This was it, wasn’t it? This was going to be his life. One person after another walking out the door, walking away, because he was just too much to deal with. The doctor had told him the situation was only going to get worse. The degeneration in his back was going to continue; tears in the discs would be more frequent, and herniation even more common. Blowouts would go from being a ‘once every few years’ thing to an ‘every few months’ thing, or hell, every few days. People would keep getting tired of him, and they’d keep leaving, because he was too much work. Too much trouble.

And they were right. He was too much trouble. He should stop even trying to connect. What was the point? He’d die alone, probably with an ice pack on his back, and that’d be that. 

The dumbest part of all, though? He’d sort of thought this time might be different. When he’d met Logan and they’d become friends, and then he’d been introduced to the others, he’d felt for the first time that these were people with whom he might actually belong. He’d never been in a relationship like this before–never dated multiple people at once like this–but with them, it worked. Their strengths bolstered one another’s weaknesses, and their differences seemed to make them closer to one another rather than driving a wedge between them. It was a perfect balance, and what’s more, his presence seemed to add to that balance, instead of throwing it off like he’d been afraid he would. They’d welcomed him with open arms, and for the last six months, he’d been happier than he’d ever been in his life. 

He should’ve known better than to assume that would last. 

He sighed, lowering his arm as the threat of sobs passed. But the tears continued to leak down his face as he lay on the useless melted ice pack, tiny little pinpricks of pain chasing each other merrily up and down his spine as he slipped into an uneasy sleep. 

* 

He didn’t know how much time had passed, but the mid-morning sun was still streaming through the window when the knock at his door woke him for the second time. 

He started awake again, then cringed at the jarring movement, and turned his head toward the door. “Who is it?” he called, thinking if it was a package he’d tell them to just leave it on the stoop. His apartment building wasn’t the best, but he didn’t think he could bear to get up right then, and anything important for the shop would be sent directly to the shop. If the package got stolen…oh well. 

But it wasn’t package delivery. “Hey, Virgil!” came a familiar voice from the other side of the door. “Can we come in?” 

“Patton?!” Virgil frowned, looking down at his watch. 11:02am. The others hadn’t been gone an hour–what were they doing back? “What’s going on?” 

“Can we come in or not?” 


“I mean…yeah, come in,” Virgil said, tensing a little. Was this it? Had they left, had a conversation about him, decided he was too much trouble, and come back to break it off officially? 


The doorknob rattled, and he heard a muffled curse, then someone said, “Hold this for a second, would",,Back Pain,

Be thankful. You are loving one of the greatest woman alive. She’s able to show you why it’s worth to be alive. Take care of the following points:

She loves breakfast in bed. Just bring her an avocado, a few pieces of toast, salt and pepper and balsamic and she will be happy, I promise. Some fruits will make it even better. It’s the perfect start for a perfect day with a perfect girl. And by the way: She’s in love with smoothies but they are kinda unhealthy because of the sugar, so don’t overdo. Just make her self made orange juice - she will be even more thankful. 

Take her to new places she has never been to. She loves to see new things and she likes to take snapshots with her polaroid camera so please be sure you carry enough films with you. 
 She likes sunsets, sunrises and everything that has to do with the sun and beauty of the nature in general. And if she loves you back she will be so happy to be with you. 

Write her. Not just text, write her letters. And not just about love but about everything that remind you of her. Be sure that she knows that you love her because she has her bad times too. And take care of her smile, please please take care of her smile. She is so beautiful when she smiles and I wouldn’t survive if she would stop smiling. 

She’s not jealous. But she expect the same. Don’t be too jealous, if she loves you, she will be honest and loyal. Her friends will take care of her to so don’t worry about her. If she is not nearby you - don’t worry. She will be fine. 

Please don’t push pressure on her. She has to feel free while she’s in a relationship with you. Appreciate her all the time. Respect her silence and support her dark times with love. She deserves someone who can do that. 

She deserves someone who can do all of that. And she likes white wine or whiskey with coke. But take care of her when she’s drinking because she can’t drink that much. Please don’t play on her, cheat on her and please don’t make jokes about her height. She is one of the greatest and biggest women alive. Please just take care of her. 

Thank you.",,For the one who loves her next,

So, I’m assuming that this whole “the first thing your soulmate says to you blahblahblah” is a worldwide thing. So many of the aus I’ve read have a quote at some point that addresses how tragic it is when people have soul words that say something like “hi” or “‘sup” which makes NO SENSE! In a world where the first thing you say to people is THAT important, WHY GOD WHY would the culture still use standard greetings? Who the fuck is still saying hello at this point? Everyone in these worlds would surely develop a personalized greeting different from everybody else’s to prevent confusion. Like how no 2 racehorses can have the same racing name? The best part is that every time people met someone new for the first time, they would try to say something that no one else had said. You’d have people meeting eachother at a job intetview, they’d shake hands, smile politely, then one of them would be like “Every Tuesday, I hard even grape purple farm house sunsets too” and this would be perfectly normal. Or you’d go up to the cash register at Starbucks and instead of saying “Hello, what can i get for you today?” She’d look you right in the eye and say “I don’t know what Space Jam is” THEN ask you what you want and she’d repeat that to every customer in the line for the rest of her career. And because they live in the AU, nobody would think it was weird. op you are forcibly opening my third eye with a crowbar and i am here for it But consider all the cultural/social variations too: - Tweens who find it absolutely hilarious to introduce themselves to everyone with their older sibling’s individual greeting phrase. - Teens and twenty-somethings desperately trying out and discarding different soulmate phrases because they’re secretly panicked it’s not unique enough and/or people will judge them for it. - Cultures where actively seeking your soulmate is considered individualistic and rude, so everyone uses the standard greeting phrase in all situations and people who have some other words on their body (e.g. “Look out for that bus!”) are discriminated against. - Family and friends wingmanning each other’s attempts to find their soulmate. “Hey dude, you know what the barista at that new Starbucks said to me today? I think it’s your words, man!” - Overprotective matchmaking parents doing the same thing, but badly. “Mom, I don’t care if he’s a doctor, that’s not even close to what my arm says.” - Incel types spamming dating sites with their personal introduction phrase and then deciding it’s a conspiracy to keep them single when the mod boots them. - College friends whimsically swapping greeting phrases and then panicking when they actually run into someone who introduces themselves that way: is it their soulmate? their friend’s soulmate? AAAAA! - Naming all your pets after your greeting phrase just in case you’re going to meet your soulmate while trying to find your pet late at night. - Tragilarious mix-ups involving new moms tranked on painkillers and/or absent-minded doctors that result in children named things like “Orange Juice Is A Windmill Choice on Sundays.” - You can always tell people who have found their soulmate because they just say “hi.”",,,
