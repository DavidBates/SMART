# SMART

This application is for intelligently labeling data by utilizing active learning.  It consists of a Django web application backed by a Postgres database and a Redis store.  The application uses Docker in development to aid in dependency management.

## Development

### Docker containers

This project uses `docker` containers organized by `docker-compose` to ease dependency management in development.  All dependencies other than the app server itself (i.e., postgres and redis) are controlled through docker.

First, install docker and docker-compose. Then navigate to `envs/[dev|prod]` and run `docker-compose up -d` to start all docker images.

The various services will be available on your machine at their standard ports, but you can override the port numbers if they conflict with other running services. For example, you don't want to run SMART's instance of Postgres on port 5432 if you already have your own local instance of Postgres running on port 5432. To override a port, create a file named `.env` in the `envs/dev` directory that looks something like this:

``` shell
# Default is 5432
EXTERNAL_POSTGRES_PORT=5433

# Default is 3000
EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_PORT=3001
```

The `.env` file is ignored by `.gitignore`.
