This directory contains data from [SemEval-2016 Task 6: Detecting Stance in Tweets](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/).

The original data file was downloaded from [http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/data/uploads/stancedataset.zip](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/data/uploads/stancedataset.zip) on June 21, 2017. This file can be found on the [Data, Evaluation, and Results](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/index.php?id=data-and-tools) page for Task 6. It is the file called "Training and test data with stance gold labels and additional labels".

The original data file includes records for five different subjects (called "targets" in the file). The Feminist Movement subject was selected for use as sample data. The `subset.py` script was used to extract records for that subject and to keep only variables of interest. The original data file isn't stored in the repo.
